                    <p>I’m <span className="name-span">Niki Quiterio</span> - born and raised in New York City. I like to describe myself as a pop culture
                       and media enthusiast (after all, I am from the world’s media capital!). </p>

                    <p>I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Communications and Media Studies from Fordham University.
                       In 2019, I took it a step further and earned my Master’s degree in Branding + Integrated
                       Communications (concentrating in Public Relations) from the City College of New York (CUNY).
                       My experience includes working in both the nonprofit and corporate sectors, where I crafted
                       communications strategies to engage employees and clients, and helped enhance company messaging and value. </p>

                    <p>Things I enjoy include writing, reading, watching documentaries, HGTV and occasional failed attempts at
                       recreating recipes I’ve seen on Master Chef. </p>
